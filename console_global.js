// learning how to use terminal with nodejs
// what's important here: before when using only javascript we had to use the browser if we wanted to see it working with nodejs we can use the terminal
// we can also run `node console` on the terminal and node will be able to understand that it's a javascript file
console.log("test"); // after my file is saved i'll type `node console.js` on the terminal and it will execute my file;

// since console is a global variable in node, let's see what others global variables are available
// for more info: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/globals.html v14.17.6
console.log(global);
